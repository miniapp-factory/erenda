512x512
A stylized 2048 tile logo featuring a 4x4 grid of numbered tiles (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048) arranged in a vibrant gradient background. The tiles are bright and colorful, each with a distinct shade that reflects its value, and the overall composition is centered with a subtle drop shadow. The background is a soft teal gradient that fades from light to dark, giving the logo a modern, energetic feel. The logo should be eye‑catching and represent the classic 2048 game in a clean, professional style.
